A monad library in TypeScript

Use monads in your code for functional programming joy.

Catling is influenced by the Scala standard library and [Cats][cats]

## Installation

Install using yarn or npm

yarn:

```
yarn add catling
```

npm:

```
npm install catling --save
```

## API

### Option

An option is a great way to represent a value which may or may not exist. An option is either a `Some` or a `None`.

```typescript
const name: Option<string> = getParameter(request, 'name')

const upper = name
  .map(trim)
  .filter(n => n.length !== 0)
  .map(n => n.toUpperCase())

console.log(upper) // Prints either "Some("JIMMY")" or "None"
```

### Either

An either represents a value consisting of one of two possible types.
It's typically used to represent the result of something that may fail. Eithers are right-biased.

```typescript
function divide(divisor: number, n: number): Either<string, number> {
  if (divisor === 0) {
    return Left('Cannot divide by zero')
  } else {
    return Right(n / divisor)
  }
}

const myNum1 = divide(5, 10)
.map(n => n + 20)

console.log(myNum1) // Prints "Right(22)"

const myNum2 = divide(0, 10)
.map(n => n + 20)

console.log(myNum2) // Prints "Left("Cannot divide by zero")"
```

### Immutable List

An immutable list behaves much like the native array, expect it cannot be mutated.

```typescript
const myList = List(1,2,3,4).map(double)

console.log(myList) // List(2,4,6,8)
```

### Writer

A writer is a context that carries with it some sort of log with its computation.

```typescript
const myWriter =  Writer(List('initial value'), 10)
                  .flatMap(val => Writer(List('adding 5'), val + 5)
                  .flatMap(val => Writer(List('doubling'), val * 2)

console.log(myWriter) // Writer(List(initial value, adding 5, doubling), 30)
```

The log part of the writer must be a semigroup, meaning it must have a `concat` method. This is used to combine the logs from the source writer.
